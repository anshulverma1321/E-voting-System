# 🗳️ Decentralized E-Voting System Using Ethereum Blockchain

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Decentralized E-Voting System Using Ethereum Blockchain** is a secure and transparent electronic voting application designed to conduct elections in a tamper-proof and trustless manner.

By leveraging **Ethereum blockchain technology**, the system ensures vote immutability, voter anonymity, and protection against fraud, making the voting process reliable and transparent.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Traditional voting systems face challenges such as:
- Vote tampering
- Lack of transparency
- Manual errors in counting
- Limited accessibility

The challenge is to design a voting system that is **secure, transparent, and decentralized**, eliminating the need for intermediaries while ensuring fairness and accuracy.

This project addresses the problem using **blockchain-based voting**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Secure voter authentication using JWT
- Ethereum blockchain for immutable vote storage
- One-vote-per-voter enforcement
- Decentralized and trustless voting process
- Admin panel to manage candidates and elections
- Real-time vote counting and result display
- User-friendly interface for voters

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Ethereum Blockchain
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Truffle Framework
- Node.js
- Metamask
- Python (FastAPI)
- MySQL Database
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## 📂 System Architecture
- **Blockchain Layer:** Handles voting logic and stores votes securely
- **Backend Layer:** FastAPI for authentication and database operations
- **Frontend Layer:** Web interface for voters and administrators
- **Wallet Integration:** Metamask for transaction signing and identity verification

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Tamper-proof vote records using blockchain
- Prevention of multiple voting
- Role-based access control (Admin / Voter)
- Secure authentication using JWT
- Decentralized storage to eliminate single points of failure

---
